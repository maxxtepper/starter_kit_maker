This is not the only way to use this tool, it is simply an example.

Instructions:
1. Establish a user bin up to the following:
	 $ mkdir -p $HOME/bin/starter_kit_maker/bin/bazel
2. Add the following line at the end of $HOME/.bashrc
	 export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
3. Create symlink of files in bin
	 $ ln -s /full-path/git_begin $HOME/bin/.
	 $ ln -s /full-path/bin/object_maker $HOME/bin/.
	 $ ln -s /full-path/git_bzl_cc $HOME/bin/.
	 $ ln -s /full-path/bin/bazel/cc_bzl_obj $HOME/bin/.

Example Usage (no bazel):
$ git_begin project_name object0 object1

Example Usage (with bazel):
$ git_bzl_cc project_name object0 object1

After git_begin, the next string will be the name of the project, and every string after that will be objects named after the strings themselves

Symlink allows you to edit the scripts in the repo to keep the executable up-to-date
