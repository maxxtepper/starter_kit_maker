This is not the only way to use this tool, it is simply an example.

Instructions:
1. Establish a user bin
	 $ mkdir $HOME/bin
2. Move script into bin
3. Add the following line at the end of $HOME/.bashrc
	 $ export PATH=$"HOME/bin:$PATH"

Example Usage:
$ git_begin project_name object0 object1

After git_begin, the next string will be the name of the project, and every string after that will be objects named after the strings themselves
