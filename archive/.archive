This is a reminder to make a class that operates on the beginning of an idea. Think about it. When you want to start an idea using c++, typically it is to generate things: objects, algorithms, data formats; and it is to save and track those things in an organzied fashion. For example, I want to build software that will lead someone into executing a technical testing and debugging of a circuit board. I want to track the power systems, probing each step along the way. Start with the first level of power. Test all that you can before you alter the system by power other domains. This is all about power domains.
Anyways.
Make a Git-Doped Machine Maker

What to do when I start a project:
specify the language
specify the project name
git init
git all the other stuff to make a thing
commit a README with the name of the project in the file, and maybe a template for an intro README
generate the first objects of the project: input as many to start as you can
-this includes .cc files with basic mehtods, .h files with a basic setup, and a makefile; this is a specific example for the c++ language. other versions of this can exist for any language.
